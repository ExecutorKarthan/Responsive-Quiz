# Description
This is a Web API project that allows the user to answer quiz question on a timed interval. This project allowed me to experiment with the Document Object Model (DOM), specifically with calling DOM items, creating DOM elements via Javascript, and then styling said items with Javascript. I learned quite a bit about hiding components in a webpage to make it seem like there were several different webpages, as well as how Javascript is limited in is ability to import and export file data. I discovered that any file imports need to be handled with Node and that standard web browsers can really only store strings via local storage. Finally, I learned about the Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm in an attempt to better randomize my questions and their corresponding answers.

# How to Use this Project
This website contains a code quiz that anyone can take. After the site loads, you can either start the quiz by clicking the "Start Quiz" button or you can see the current high scores by clicking the "Leader Board" link. If you start the quiz, a question will pop up and you are to click on an answer you think is correct. After 60 seconds of quizzing, the quiz will be complete and you will be taken to a screen that lets you see your score and enter in your name/initials. If your score is higher than the lowest score on the Leader Board, then it will be added. From there, you can select a button to require and you can try to beat your score in a faster time.
